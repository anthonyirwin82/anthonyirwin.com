            <p>I have used computers all my life and started with an Amstrad CPC 6128 which had a 128kb of ram and no hard disk drive. I started programming when I was around 10 years old and started by typing in computer game code listings in the basic programming language and making minor changes to those games.</p>
            <p>In high school, I did programming courses and used Turbo Pascal 7 and Visual Basic 5 as the programming languages taught in the school.</p>
            <p>In 1998 I started using Linux as it had way more to offer than windows in the way of programming languages and servers that I could run.</p>

            <p>In January 2000 I started a computer traineeship with ByTech Computer Systems as I knew Linux I started setting up file servers, print servers and fax servers for clients. Back then business-grade printers did not have print or fax servers built into them and Windows NT was expensive for many small businesses so Linux was a perfect solution for them as they could upgrade their desktop computers and their old computers could be turned into a Linux Server.</p>
            <p>I also took on the role of building and maintaining the companies websites and also built custom php and mysql applications to perform business tasks.</p>
